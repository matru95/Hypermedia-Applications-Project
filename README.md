This repository contains the whole project of the website for a Medical Clinic, which name is "Leonardo Da Vinci".

The website has been realized writing both FRONT-END and BACK-END.


## FRONT-END

As regards FRONT-END, I used Bootstrap to build my static site along with some css styles.
Then I used the javascript code to retrieve data as jsons (regarding: doctors, locations, services)
from the database in the BACK-END and manipulate them to add HTML code dynamically into my pages.

## BACK-END

As regards BACK-END, I created jsons files for initializing my database with doctors, locations, services.
Then I added REST's GETs for each of these tables on database: doctors, locations, servicess.
